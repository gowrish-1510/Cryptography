RSA Encryption Overview
================================

RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman) is a widely used public-key cryptosystem for secure data transmission. It uses asymmetric encryption, meaning the encryption and decryption keys are different. RSA is named after its inventors: Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir, and Leonard Adleman.

**How RSA Works**
----------------

RSA relies on the mathematical properties of large prime numbers. It involves the following components:

* Public Key: Used for encryption and distributed publicly.
* Private Key: Used for decryption and kept secret.

The strength of RSA encryption is based on the difficulty of factoring large prime numbers.

Key Generation
-----------------

RSA keys are generated as follows:

1. **Select Primes**: Choose two distinct large prime numbers, `p` and `q`.
2. **Compute `n`**: Calculate `n = p × q`.
3. **Compute `φ(n)`**: Compute `φ(n) = (p - 1) × (q - 1)`, where `φ` is Euler's totient function.
4. **Select Public Key `e`**: Choose an integer `e` such that `1 < e < φ(n)` and `gcd(e, φ(n)) = 1`.
5. **Calculate Private Key `d`**: Determine `d` as the modular multiplicative inverse of `e` modulo `φ(n)`, i.e., `d ≡ e^(-1) mod φ(n)`.

The public key consists of `(e, n)`, and the private key is `d`.

Encryption Process
---------------------

To encrypt a message `M`:

1. Represent `M` as an integer `m`, where `0 ≤ m < n`.
2. Compute the ciphertext `C` as `C ≡ m^e mod n`.
3. The ciphertext `C` can be shared securely over public channels.

Decryption Process
---------------------

To decrypt ciphertext `C`:

1. Compute the plaintext `m` as `m ≡ C^d mod n`.
2. The original message `M` can then be recovered from `m`.

Security Considerations
---------------------------

* **Key Length**: Longer keys (e.g., 2048 bits) provide higher security.
* **Prime Selection**: Randomly generated large primes are crucial for security.
* **Key Storage**: Keep the private key secure to prevent unauthorized decryption.

Usage
------

* **Encryption**: Use the recipient's public key to encrypt sensitive data.
* **Decryption**: Use the private key to decrypt encrypted data.
